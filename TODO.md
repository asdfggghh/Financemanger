# Finance Manager Project TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add missing methods to db_manager.py (get_total_balance, get_income_for_period, etc.)
- [x] Create stub widget files (transactions.py, budget.py, reports.py, goals.py, settings.py)
- [x] Create main.py entry point script
- [x] Create requirements.txt with dependencies

## Next Steps
- [ ] Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Run the application: `python src/main.py`
- [ ] Test the basic functionality (dashboard should display with charts)
- [ ] Add sample data to database for testing
- [ ] Implement full functionality for each widget (transactions, budget, etc.)

## Notes
- The application uses PyQt6 for GUI and matplotlib for charts
- SQLite database is created automatically on first run
- Dashboard displays summary cards and charts
- Other tabs are stubs and show "Coming Soon" messages
